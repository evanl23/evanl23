## About Me

âœ… Check out [Terminal Dash](https://github.com/evanl23/terminal-dash)! A game I wrote in ASCII for the terminal following my favorite childhood game *Geometry Dash* created by RobTop. 

Currently building an iPhone detachable [Raman](https://github.com/evanl23/RamanSpectroscopy) spectroscope. This device identifies the unique chemical signatures of a substance by firing a laser at it and then analyzing the scattered light. I also have a startup/project [TextMarley](https://github.com/TextMarleyAI/) that simplifies deadlines for college students and serves an proactive personal assistant for everyday tasks such as emails, meetings, homework, etc. 

I have done work with [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative finance research club at BU, where I implemented Monte Carlo methods and algorithmic trading strategies.

My email inbox is open: eliu23@bu.edu.
