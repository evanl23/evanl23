### About Me

- CS + Econ major @ BostonU '27
- Interested in machine learning applications in finance and signal processing
- When I'm not coding or studying, I like to road bike, ski, and read Tolkien

I am currently building an iPhone detachable [Raman](https://github.com/evanl23/RamanSpectroscopy) spectroscope with the intent of identifying unique chemical signatures by firing a laser at an unknown substance and collecting and analyzing the emitted Raman scatter. I am also working on a startup/project [TextMarley](https://github.com/TextMarleyAI/) that simplifies deadlines for college students and serves an proactive personal assistant for everyday tasks such as emails, meetings, homework, etc. 

In the past, I have done work with [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative finance research club at BU, where I implemented Monte Carlo methods and algorithmic trading strategies.
