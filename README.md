### About Me

- CS + Econ major @ BostonU '27
- Currently interested in machine learning applications in finance and signal processing
- When I'm not coding or studying, I like to road bike, ski, and learn about Tolkien

I am currently building a startup/project [Project](https://github.com/evanl23/AI-Texting-Assistant) that simplifies deadlines for college students and serves an assistant for everyday tasks such as emails, meetings, homework, etc. This is build purely for text. I am also working on a Trading Engine Server [Project](https://github.com/evanl23/Trading-Engine) that hosts trading servers, creates orders, and matches orders for clients. 

\I am also starting a side quant project that finds arbitrage opportunities in dual-class securities. 

In the past, I have done work with [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative finance research club at BU, where I implemented Monte Carlo methods and algorithmic trading strategies.
